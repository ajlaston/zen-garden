                            <h3>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>
                            <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,
                                incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
                            <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the
                                tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.</p>
                            <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the
                                masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and
                                invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <h3>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h3>
                            <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite,
                                inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the
                                list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML
                                remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.
                            </p>
                            <p>CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only
                                way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what
                                it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty
                                from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we
                                can always push it further.</p>

                                <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so
                                    strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough
                                    that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. Please see the CSS Resource
                                    Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.</p>
                                <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem
                                    daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed
                                    links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
                                <p>Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed
                                    your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file
                                    to a web server under your control. Send us a link to an archive of that file and
                                    all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it
                                    on our server.</p>

                                    showing people how amazing CSS really can be. This site serves as equal parts
                                    inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be
                                    tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>

                            <h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                            <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited
                                to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen
                                Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks
                                viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your
                                CSS validates.</p>
                            <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now.
                                When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most
                                modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days —
                                especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across
                                every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work
                                in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over
                                90% of the population).</p>
                            <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep
                                objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting
                                visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point of needing another garden-related
                                design.</p>
                            <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your
                                graphics (with limited exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we ask you release
                                your CSS under a Creative Commons license identical to the one on this site so that
                                others may learn from your work.</p>
